# **Python Language**

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets aimed at applications in Computer Science. The code covers various topics and can be used as learning resources, references, or to solve specific problems related to Computer Science.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific category of code. Below is an overview of the available categories:

- `Algorithms`: Implementations of classic and advanced algorithms, such as sorting, searching, graphs, optimization, among others.

- `Data-Structures`: Implementations of data structures like lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

- `Image-Processing`: Code related to image processing, including manipulation, analysis, filtering, and computer vision.

- `Machine-Learning`: Examples of machine learning algorithms and techniques, including popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

- `Neural-Networks`: Implementations of artificial neural networks and examples of deep learning applications.

- `Cryptography`: Code related to cryptography and information security, including classical and modern cryptography algorithms.

- `Graphical-Interfaces`: Examples of creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) using libraries like tkinter and PyQT.

- `Web`: Examples of web development in Python, including frameworks like Flask and Django.

- `General-Examples`: Miscellaneous code that doesn't fit into the previous categories but is useful for demonstration and learning purposes.

## Requirements
