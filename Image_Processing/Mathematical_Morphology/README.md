# **Mathematical Morphology in Digital Image Processing**

This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets and examples related to Mathematical Morphology in the field of Digital Image Processing. Mathematical Morphology is a fundamental concept used for image processing tasks like enhancing features, segmenting objects, and extracting relevant information from images.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific aspect or operation in Mathematical Morphology. Below is an overview of the available categories:

- `Erosion-and-Dilation`: Code examples and implementations of basic erosion and dilation operations. Erosion shrinks the boundaries of objects, while dilation expands them.

- `Opening-and-Closing`: Examples of opening and closing operations. Opening is an erosion followed by dilation and is useful for removing noise, while closing is a dilation followed by erosion and is used for closing small holes.

- `Hit-or-Miss-Transform`: Code related to the Hit-or-Miss Transform, a technique used for detecting specific patterns or shapes in binary images.

- `Skeletonization`: Implementations and examples of skeletonization techniques, used to reduce the shape of an object to its skeletal representation. This is useful for shape analysis and pattern recognition.

- `Top-Hat-and-Bottom-Hat`: Examples of Top Hat and Bottom Hat operations. Top Hat is the difference between the original image and its opening, while Bottom Hat is the difference between the closing and the original image. These operations are used to enhance fine details in images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python installed in your environment.

- Python Libraries: Some code may require the installation of specific libraries. You can check the requirements in each subdirectory.
