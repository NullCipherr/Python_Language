# **Digital Image Processing**

This repository contains a collection of Python code examples and tools related to Digital Image Processing (DIP). Digital Image Processing is a field of study that involves manipulating digital images to enhance, analyze, and extract information from them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific aspect or operation in Digital Image Processing. Below is an overview of the available categories:

- `Image-Enhancement`: Code examples for enhancing the quality and visual appearance of images. Techniques like contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and image sharpening are covered.

- `Image-Segmentation`: Implementations of various image segmentation algorithms, used for partitioning an image into meaningful regions or objects.

- `Feature-Extraction`: Code snippets for extracting useful features from images, including edge detection, corner detection, and texture analysis.

- `Image-Filtering`: Examples of applying various filters to images for tasks such as noise reduction, blurring, and smoothing.

- `Geometric-Transformation`: Code related to geometric transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation of images.

- `Morphological-Operations`: Code examples and tools related to mathematical morphology operations, such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and skeletonization.

- `Computer-Vision`: Implementations of computer vision algorithms and techniques for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR).

- `Deep-Learning`: Code examples and notebooks demonstrating the use of deep learning models for image processing tasks, including image classification and segmentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed in your environment.

- Python Libraries: Some code may require the installation of specific libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, or TensorFlow. You can check the requirements in each subdirectory.
